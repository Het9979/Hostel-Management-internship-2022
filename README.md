Hostel Management
This a project which was developed during the internship of summer 2022 . The project consists of a website of a hostel and helps the admin in management duties using some technologies like HTML , CSS , JAVASCRIPT , PHP and MYSQL.
It is a fully working project developed during a period of one month .
It consists of three types :
 A basic website of the hostel that makes it easier for students to get the overview of what the hostel would be like.
There are 2 modules inside the website one for the admin to manage the data of the currently residing students and one for newly students and existing students.

Website contains basic information about the hostel . It also shows the user what types of rooms are available at what price and what are the specifications of the room ( like 3 sharing AC ,3 sharing NON AC). It also gives the user an idea about the amenities provided by the hostel like swimming pool, pool tables , table tennis , free wifi, library room for studying and other amenities.
After the basic website there are two modules . 
Student module 
Admin module

Student Module: Here the student can login through their username and password and then they can edit their personal details , update their personal details , get their room details , get specific bed details of their room . They can update their username and password by their own so that they don't have to rely on the admin for this purpose.
For new students they can sign up by filling their details and then they can check for room availability and on that basis inquire about the room. if they want to get admission in the hostel they need to go to admin for the allotment of their room and bed based their choice and based on the availability.
Admin Module: The admin has to login through the given credentials and than he/she can see the list of all the students present in the hostel , they can add rooms and allot beds to the students by checking the availablity of bed. Admin can update some details of students , can check rooms and even check which student is present on the particular bed no.
